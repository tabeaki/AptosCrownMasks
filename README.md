----- 
①Optimism ETH Masks (Price: Free Mint)
-NFT in our beginnings.
-Collection of 6,000 pieces in Free Mint.
-We will register TofuNFT, etc.
-We want to collaborate a lot more than just Optimism!
-We will not collaborate if there is a cost involved.

----- 
②Aptos Token Masks (Price: T.B.D)
-aptos is a new Layer1 and is being developed by Facebook (formerly Libra) developers.
-Freemint plans to have about 100,000 collections.
-NFT is currently in production.
-We will use a new programming language called MOVE and will investigate how it differs from Solidity.
-We plan to expand with new market prices such as Martin Wallet and Pontem.

----- 
③Sui T.B.D. Masks
-sui is a new Layer1 and is being developed by Facebook (formerly Libra) developers.
-There will be over 100,000 collections in the mint.
-OP ETH Masks EVM NFTs will be experimented to see if they can be migrated to Sui.
-Sui runs games in Unity, so we will research if we can create value with the NFTs we have issued so far in combination with Unity games.
